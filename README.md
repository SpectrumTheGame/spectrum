## Description 
Our game is a 2D mobile puzzle game in which a user plucks various strings to produce “traveling wave” forces that move a ball towards a goal. The core mechanic involves the plucking of strings to emit forces of different magnitudes. After a player drags and releases the string with their finger, it will vibrate back and forth and produce a wave that travels in the direction opposite of the pull (similar to the mechanism in a slingshot). We use this mechanic to move the ball to the goal!
